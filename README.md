# Cisco-Packet-Tracer-Network-Topology
I'm have started my Cloud Computing course at Besant Technologies, Anna Nagar. As part of my learning, I’ve been working on CCNA-based projects that involve configuring network connections between various devices such as routers, switches, WiFi, PCs, tablets, and mobile devices.

One of my recent projects focused on DHCP configuration:<br>
✅ Configured routers to assign IP addresses dynamically within a defined range.<br>
✅ Connected multiple devices and enabled DHCP to automate IP allocation.<br>
✅ Successfully tested device-to-device communication using ping to ensure seamless connectivity.<br>

This hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of networking fundamentals, and I'm excited to explore more in the field of cloud computing!
